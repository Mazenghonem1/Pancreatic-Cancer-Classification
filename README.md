## Overview
Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive cancer with low survival rates due to challenges in early detection. By analyzing urinary biomarkers, this project seeks to provide a machine learning-based tool to assist in early diagnosis, thereby potentially improving outcomes for patients.

## Dataset
**Source**: [Kaggle - Urinary Biomarkers for Pancreatic Cancer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/urinary-biomarkers-for-pancreatic-cancer)  
The dataset includes features related to urinary biomarkers and their association with pancreatic cancer diagnoses. It is used as the basis for developing predictive models.  

**Preprocessing Steps**:
- Handling missing values.
- Normalizing and scaling features.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Feature engineering to enhance model input quality.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and presentation of results.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data cleaning (handling missing or inconsistent values).
   - Normalization and scaling to prepare features for model input.
   - Feature engineering for improved model performance.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Explored multiple machine learning classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Measured model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Achieved an overall accuracy of **84%** on test data.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Presented insights through plots and charts (e.g., feature importance, confusion matrix).
